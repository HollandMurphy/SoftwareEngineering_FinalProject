XINVENTORY SOFTWARE PROGRAM

README

XINVENTORY is a software program that analyzes two types of data from the operations of retail businesses.  The first type of information is on inventory that is currently in-stock.  The second type of information is on sold inventory from an arbitrary point in time.  

For logging into the application, the user needs to click the register button and create an account.  Any email will work that includes the @ sign.  The password must be a length of 4 characters.

This iteration of the program does not currently support live API's that integrate with databases that collect, store and display the information.  Currently the data is submitted in 2 CSV files that are included with the code.  The are respectively named inventory.csv and soldInventory.csv.  These files were created to provide a working prototype of the software solution.  These files are to be uploaded to the ./inventory/addInventory page of the application.  

When logging into the system the user is taken to the displayInventory page that is the main part of the application.  The page is nearly complete but is limited in functionality in the current iteration of the project.  

The settings for the inventory is defaulted to 3 month supply of inventory but may be customized to any arbitrary number.  The settings can be set globally or to each individual or to some models based on preference.
